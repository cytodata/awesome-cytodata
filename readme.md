[Cytodata](https://cytodata.org/) refers to a community of researchers and resources involved in the **image-based profiling** of **biological phenotypes**.
These **biological phenotypes** are typically induced by genetic or chemical perturbations and often represent disease states.
**Image-based profiling** is used to inspect these phenotypes to uncover biological insight including discovering the impact of genetic alterations and determining the mechanism of action of compounds.

This page represents a curated list of software, datasets, landmark publications, and image-based profiling methods.
Our goal is to provide researchers, both new and established, a place to discover and document awesome Cytodata resources.
